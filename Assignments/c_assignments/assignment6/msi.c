You MUST add the command to rebuild your initramfs, otherwise, the changes won't be applied on boot:
Bash
sudo mkinitcpio -P

And then, a reboot:
Bash
sudo reboot

Reasoning: Even though the msi-ec-git package and disabling Secure Boot were initial attempts, the successful method to get MControlCenter working was specifically the ec_sys approach combined with rebuilding the initramfs. Your shortcut document should reflect the exact sequence that worked persistently.
Revised MSI Control Center Fix (Recommended Order):
1. Disable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI.
2. Install necessary build tools:
3. Bash
4. sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel linux-headers
5. 
6. (Note: yay -S msi-ec-git was an attempt that failed due to firmware incompatibility, so you don't necessarily need it if ec_sys is the working path for you.)
7. Configure ec_sys for write support and persistent loading:
8. Bash
9. echo "options ec_sys write_support=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ec_sys.conf echo "ec_sys" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/ec_sys.conf 
10. Rebuild Initramfs (CRUCIAL FOR PERSISTENCE):
11. Bash
12. sudo mkinitcpio -P
13. 
14. Reboot your system:
15. Bash
16. sudo reboot
17. 
18. Verify ec_sys is loaded and has write support (after reboot):
19. Bash
20. lsmod | grep ec_sys
21. cat /sys/module/ec_sys/parameters/write_support
22. 
23. (Both should show output / Y)
24. Install MControlCenter application:
	* Download the tar file (e.g., 
	* MControlCenter-0.5.1-bin.tar.gz) from the MControlCenter GitHub Releases(https://github.com/dmitry-s93/MControlCenter/releases/tag/0.5.1).
	* Extract the tar file.
	* Navigate to the extracted directory in your terminal:
	* Bash
	* cd ~/Downloads/MControlCenter-0.5.1-bin/ # Adjust path if different
	* Run the install script:
	* Bash
	* sudo ./install.sh # Or sudo ./install depending on the file name

msi-ec module is not loaded/installed.  
lsmod | grep msi_ec does nothing in terminal 

#HER	

When `lsmod | grep msi_ec` does nothing, it means the `msi_ec` kernel module is **not currently loaded** into your system's kernel. This is why MControlCenter is complaining that the module isn't loaded/installed.

Since you've already installed the `msi-ec-git` package, the next step is to try and load it manually.

1.  **Try to manually load the module:**
    In your terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe msi-ec
    ```

      * **What this command does:** `modprobe` is used to add or remove modules from the Linux kernel. `sudo` is needed because it's a system-level operation.

2.  **Check if it loaded after `modprobe`:**
    After running the `sudo modprobe msi-ec` command, check again to see if it's loaded:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep msi_ec
    ```

      * If it successfully loaded, you should now see output related to `msi_ec`.

3.  **Try MControlCenter again:**
    If `lsmod | grep msi_ec` now shows output, try launching MControlCenter to see if it recognizes the module.

**If `sudo modprobe msi-ec` gives an error or `lsmod` still shows no output:**

  * **Module not found:** It might mean the module wasn't built correctly or isn't in a place the kernel can find.
  * **Module incompatible:** It could be incompatible with your specific kernel version (6.15.7-arch1-1).
  * **Secure Boot:** If Secure Boot is enabled in your BIOS, it can prevent unsigned kernel modules like `msi-ec` from loading.

If the manual `modprobe` doesn't work, we'll need to investigate further, possibly by checking the `dmesg` output for any errors related to `msi-ec` or looking into the `ec_sys` write support method.


#ME 
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'msi_ec': Operation not supported


#HER 
You're getting "modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'msi\_ec': Operation not supported". This is a critical error message. It means that even though the `msi_ec` module is present, your kernel is refusing to load it.

Here's why this "Operation not supported" error usually occurs and what to do:

1.  **Secure Boot is Enabled:** This is the **most common reason** for "Operation not supported" when dealing with custom or third-party kernel modules like `msi-ec`. If Secure Boot is enabled in your laptop's BIOS/UEFI settings, it will prevent the loading of any kernel modules that are not signed with a key trusted by your system. `msi-ec` from the AUR is typically not signed.

      * **Solution:** **Disable Secure Boot in your laptop's BIOS/UEFI settings.** You'll need to reboot your laptop and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup (often by pressing `F2`, `Del`, or another key right after powering on). Look for a "Security" or "Boot" tab and find the "Secure Boot" option to disable it. Save changes and exit.

2.  **Kernel Version Mismatch / Module Not Built for Current Kernel:** While `msi-ec-git` is supposed to use DKMS to rebuild the module for your current kernel (6.15.7-arch1-1), sometimes this can fail or get out of sync.

      * **Solution:** Ensure `linux-headers` matches your exact kernel version. You've already confirmed `linux-headers` is up to date, which is good. You can try forcing a reinstallation of `msi-ec-git` to trigger a DKMS rebuild:
        ```bash
        yay -S msi-ec-git
        ```
        Select 'y' to reinstall if prompted.

3.  **Module Blacklisted or Conflicting:** Less likely, but possible. Check `/etc/modprobe.d/` for any files that might be blacklisting `msi_ec` or a conflicting module.

**Your immediate next step should be to check and disable Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings.** After doing that, reboot and then try `sudo modprobe msi-ec` again.

#ME
this is output [superuser@SuperUser ~]$ sudo dmesg | grep -i "msi_ec"

#HER


Okay, so to summarize the current situation:

  * You successfully installed `msi-ec-git` using `yay`.
  * You've confirmed that Secure Boot is disabled in your BIOS, and you've rebooted.
  * However, when you run `sudo modprobe msi-ec`, you still get the error: "modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'msi\_ec': Operation not supported".
  * MControlCenter still shows "The msi-ec module is not loaded/installed".

This is a persistent "Operation not supported" error even after disabling Secure Boot, which means we need to look deeper.

Here's the next set of troubleshooting steps:

1.  **Check Kernel Logs for More Specific Errors (`dmesg`):**
    When a kernel module fails to load, the kernel usually logs a more detailed reason. This is the most crucial step right now.
    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    dmesg | grep -i msi_ec
    ```

    or, for more context, just:

    ```bash
    dmesg | tail -n 50 # Shows the last 50 kernel messages
    ```

    Look for any lines that mention `msi_ec` or `module` and `error`, `fail`, `rejected`, `denied`, or similar terms. The output here will be vital to understand *why* the operation is not supported.

2.  **Verify Module Path and Permissions:**
    Even if `yay` installed it, let's confirm the module file exists and has correct permissions.

    ```bash
    sudo find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name "msi_ec.ko*"
    ```

    This command will search for the `msi_ec.ko` (kernel object) file within your current kernel's module directory. If it returns nothing, the module wasn't placed correctly.

3.  **Check `msi-ec` Project Issues/Compatibility:**
    Given the persistent "Operation not supported", it's possible that this specific `msi-ec` module either:

      * Does not support your exact MSI laptop model.
      * Has known issues with your specific Linux kernel version (6.15.7-arch1-1).

    I'll search for common issues with `msi-ec` and "Operation not supported" on Arch Linux or for your kernel version.
    You've done the right thing by ensuring Secure Boot is off and reinstalling `msi-ec-git`. The "Operation not supported" error is very specific and usually points to one of a few critical issues.

Let's break down the next steps based on that error:

### 1\. Check Kernel Logs for Detailed Error (`dmesg`)

This is the most important step now. When `modprobe` fails with "Operation not supported", the kernel usually logs *why*.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i "msi_ec"
dmesg | grep -i "module" | grep -i "error\|fail\|rejected\|denied"
```

Look carefully at the output of these commands. It might tell us:

  * If the module itself is corrupted.
  * If there's a specific kernel security feature or a hardware incompatibility preventing it from loading.
  * For example, the logs might say "kernel: module verification failed: signature is missing" (if Secure Boot was still an issue) or "kernel: MSI-EC: Unsupported device" if your specific laptop model isn't recognized by the `msi-ec` driver.

### 2\. Verify Module Presence

Let's double-check that the `msi_ec.ko` file (the actual kernel module) is where it's supposed to be for your current kernel (6.15.7-arch1-1).

```bash
sudo find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name "msi_ec.ko*"
```

This command should output the path to the `msi_ec.ko.zst` (or just `.ko`) file. If it doesn't, it means the module wasn't correctly built or installed into the kernel's module directory by DKMS.

### 3\. Consider `ec_sys` (Alternative Approach)

If `msi-ec` continues to fail, an alternative for some MSI laptops is to use the more generic `ec_sys` kernel module with write support enabled. However, this method requires caution as directly writing to the embedded controller can be risky if done incorrectly or on an unsupported device.

**Only consider this if `msi-ec` absolutely won't load and your `dmesg` output points to a compatibility issue with `msi-ec` specifically.**

  * **Steps for `ec_sys` (CAUTION ADVISED):**
    1.  **Ensure Secure Boot is Disabled.** (You've already done this.)
    2.  **Create a modprobe configuration file for `ec_sys`:**
        ```bash
        echo "options ec_sys write_support=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ec_sys.conf
        ```
    3.  **Add `ec_sys` to modules to load at boot:**
        ```bash
        echo "ec_sys" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/ec_sys.conf
        ```
    4.  **Reboot your system.**
    5.  After reboot, check if `ec_sys` loaded with write support:
        ```bash
        lsmod | grep ec_sys
        cat /sys/module/ec_sys/parameters/write_support
        ```
        The `cat` command should output `Y`.
    6.  Then try MControlCenter.

### What the search results suggest:

  * Multiple users on Arch Linux forums and Ubuntu forums have encountered the "modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'msi\_ec': Operation not supported" error.
  * A common reason (besides Secure Boot) is that the `msi-ec` driver **does not support their specific MSI laptop model**. The maintainers often note that the EC (Embedded Controller) mapping varies significantly between MSI models and even generations. You are advised to check the `msi-ec` GitHub page for supported devices before use.
  * If your model isn't officially supported by `msi-ec`, it's unlikely to work. In such cases, people often resort to booting Windows to change settings or use tools like NBFC (NoteBook Fan Control) which, while unmaintained, sometimes work for fan control.

**Please provide the output of `dmesg | grep -i "msi_ec"` and `sudo find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name "msi_ec.ko*"` first.** This will give us direct clues about why the module isn't loading.



#ALTERNATIVE APProached 3 worked 


there was another converstaion which i missed that part 

You're seeing the error "The msi-ec module is not loaded/installed. Check the \<About\> page for more info." even after installing `msi-ec`. This indicates that while the `msi-ec` package itself might be installed, the **kernel module** it provides isn't loading correctly or isn't being recognized by MControlCenter.

This is a common hurdle with these types of hardware control utilities on Linux, as they require direct interaction with your laptop's embedded controller (EC), which is very hardware-specific.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening and how to approach it:

### Why is this happening?

  * **Kernel Module Requirement:** MControlCenter relies on a kernel module called `msi-ec` (or sometimes `ec_sys` with write support) to communicate with your MSI laptop's embedded controller. This module needs to be loaded into your running Linux kernel.
  * **Module Not Loaded:** Even if `msi-ec-git` was installed, the module might not be loaded automatically at boot, or it might be incompatible with your specific kernel version or laptop model.
  * **Read-Only EC Tables:** The EC tables are often read-only by default, and write support might need to be explicitly enabled for MControlCenter to function fully.
  * **Secure Boot:** Secure Boot in your BIOS can sometimes interfere with loading custom or unsigned kernel modules.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Potentially Fix:

1.  **Check if the `msi-ec` module is loaded:**
    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep msi_ec
    ```

    If you see output, the module is loaded. If there's no output, it's not loaded.

2.  **Manually Load the Module (if not loaded):**
    Try to load it manually:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe msi-ec
    ```

    If this command runs without error, try opening MControlCenter again.

3.  **Enable `ec_sys` Write Support (if `msi-ec` doesn't work or if your system uses `ec_sys`):**
    Some guides suggest enabling write support for `ec_sys` (a more generic embedded controller module). **Be extremely cautious when modifying EC settings, as incorrect changes can damage your laptop.**

      * **Disable Secure Boot in BIOS:** If enabled, disable Secure Boot in your laptop's BIOS/UEFI settings.
      * **Create a modprobe configuration file:**
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/ec_sys.conf
        ```
        Add the following line to the file:
        ```
        options ec_sys write_support=1
        ```
        Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter for nano).
      * **Add `ec_sys` to modules-load.d:**
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/ec_sys.conf
        ```
        Add the following line:
        ```
        ec_sys
        ```
        Save and exit.
      * **Reboot your system.**
      * After reboot, verify write support:
        ```bash
        cat /sys/module/ec_sys/parameters/write_support
        ```
        It should output `Y`.

4.  **Rebuild DKMS Modules:**
    Since you're on an Arch-based system (Bluestar Linux), `msi-ec-git` typically uses DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) to ensure the module is rebuilt against your kernel whenever it updates. If your kernel updated recently, the module might need a rebuild.

      * Ensure `dkms` and `linux-headers` are installed:
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S dkms linux-headers
        ```
        (Your screenshot shows `linux-headers` are up to date, which is good).
      * Sometimes, simply reinstalling the `msi-ec-git` package can trigger a DKMS rebuild.

5.  **Check for specific MSI-EC device support:**
    The `msi-ec` driver specifically supports certain MSI laptop models. If your laptop model isn't listed as supported by the `msi-ec` project, it might not work fully or at all. You can check the `msi-ec` GitHub page for supported devices.

Given that you've just installed `msi-ec-git`, the most common first step is to simply try to **reboot your system** if you haven't already. Sometimes, the module just needs a fresh boot to load.

If after a reboot it still doesn't work, try steps 1 and 2 to see if the module is loading and if manual loading helps. If not, then consider step 3 (enabling `ec_sys` write support) but proceed with caution due to the risks involved.


##if Mcontrol centr doesnt work on reboot 


#ME
we ran into same issue again after reboot -
#HER

Oh no, I understand how frustrating that can be! It's definitely disappointing when a fix seems to work, only to revert after a reboot.
You're seeing "The msi-ec module is not loaded/installed" again in MControlCenter, even after the ec_sys parameters seemed to be correctly set and you got Y for write_support.
This indicates that while you successfully loaded ec_sys manually, it's not persisting across reboots, or MControlCenter is still looking specifically for msi-ec or has some cached state.
Let's re-verify the persistence of ec_sys and how MControlCenter interacts with it.
Step 1: Verify ec_sys is still loaded and has write support after reboot
Open your terminal and run these two commands again:
1. Check if ec_sys module is loaded:
2. Bash
3. lsmod | grep ec_sys
4. 
5. Expected output: You should see a line with ec_sys. If not, it means the module isn't loading at boot.
6. Check if ec_sys write support is enabled:
7. Bash
8. cat /sys/module/ec_sys/parameters/write_support
9. 
10. Expected output: You should see Y. If you see N or no output, the write support option isn't being applied.
Step 2: Ensure ec_sys configuration is persistent
